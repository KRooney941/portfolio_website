    <h4>Experience</h4>
    <p>Prior to learning to code I worked in the health and social care sector as both a support worker level 2 and a DBI practitioner. Due to the nature of these jobs I had to learn to think on my feet as everyday was different and never knew what to expect. It also instilled in me a love of teamwork as there was always support not just for learning new things, but also the emotional support which was key in that environment. </p>
    <p>I also have a passion for volunteering and have spent a large part of my adult life doing so. I have worked with both <a className="FDAMH" href="https://fdamh.org.uk/">Falkirk's Mental Health Association</a> as a befriender volunteer and a helpline volunteer with <a className="CRUSE" href="https://www.crusescotland.org.uk/">Cruse Bereavement Scotland</a>. I am proud to say that I am now a volunteer with the <a className="STA" href="https://www.scottishtecharmy.org/">Scottish Tech Army</a>  and can't wait to help out anyway I can.</p>
    <p>I am currently enrolled on a 16 week intensive course at <a className="codeclan" href="https://codeclan.com/">Codeclan</a> where we gain over 800 hours worth of coding practice in Python, JavaScript and Java.</p>
