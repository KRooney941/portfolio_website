    <p>Other than programming, I am a proud budgie dad to Frank and Ted. I've attached a picture for your viewing pleasure. I am also a budding guitarist at the <a className="GFW" href="https://gfw.scot/">Glasgow Folk Workshop</a> and lover of folk music (in the top 0.5% of Corries listeners on Spotify last year). My other hobbies include learning Gaelic, I recently lost out on a 100 day streak on Duolingo by one day because I went on holiday. Tha mi cho br√≤nach! </p>
